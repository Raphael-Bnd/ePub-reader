# ePub-reader
A simple ePub reader built with HTML, CSS, and jQuery, designed to run entirely in the browser. 

This project is a browser-based ePub reader developed for learning and experimentation with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (jQuery).
The main goal is to explore file handling, dynamic content rendering, and UI logic in a simple and lightweight web application.
